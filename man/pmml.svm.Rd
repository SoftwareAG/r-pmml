Generate the PMML representation of an svm object from the \pkg{e1071} package.

\details{
Classification and regression models are represented in the PMML
SupportVectorMachineModel format. One-Classification models are represented
in the PMML AnomalyDetectionModel format. Please see below for details on
the differences.

\section{Classification and Regression Models}{


Note that the sign of the coefficient of each support vector flips between the R object
and the exported PMML file for classification and regression models. This is due to the minor
difference in the training/scoring formula between the LIBSVM algorithm and the DMG specification.
Hence the output value of each support vector machine has a sign flip between the DMG definition and
the svm prediction function.

In a classification model, even though the output of the support vector machine has
a sign flip, it does not affect the final predicted category. This is because in the
DMG definition, the winning category is defined as the left side of threshold 0 while
the LIBSVM defines the winning category as the right side of threshold 0.

For a regression model, the exported PMML code has two OutputField elements. The OutputField
\code{predictedValue} shows the support vector machine output per DMG definition. The OutputField
\code{svm_predict_function} gives the value corresponding to the R predict function for the svm
model. This output should be used when making model predictions.

\section{One-Classification SVM Models}{


For a one-classification svm (OCSVM) model, the PMML has two OutputField elements:
\code{anomalyScore} and one of \code{anomaly} or \code{outlier}.

The OutputField \code{anomalyScore} is the signed distance to the separating boundary;
\code{anomalyScore} corresponds to the \code{decision.values} attribute of the output of the
svm predict function in R.

The second OutputField depends the value of \code{detect_anomaly}. By default, \code{detect_anomaly} is TRUE,
which results in the second OutputField being \code{anomaly}.
The \code{anomaly} OutputField is TRUE when an anomaly is detected.
This field conforms to the DMG definition of an anomaly detection model. This value is the
opposite of the prediction by the e1071::svm object in R.

Setting \code{detect_anomaly} to FALSE results in the second field instead being \code{inlier}.
This OutputField is TRUE when an inlier is
detected, and conforms to the e1071 definition of one-class SVMs. This field is FALSE when
an anomaly is detected; that is, the R svm model predicts whether an observation belongs to the
class. When comparing the predictions from R and PMML, this field should be used, since it
will match R's output.

For example, say that for an an observation, the R OCSVM model predicts a positive
decision value of 0.4 and label of TRUE. According to the R object, this means that the
observation is an inlier. By default, the PMML export of this model will give the following for the
same input: \code{anomalyScore = 0.4, anomaly = "false"}. According to the PMML, the observation is not an anomaly.
If the same R object is instead exported with \code{detect_anomaly = FALSE},
the PMML will then give: \code{anomalyScore = 0.4, inlier = "true"}, and this result agrees with R.

Note that there is no sign flip for \code{anomalyScore} between R and PMML for OCSVM models.

To export a OCSVM model, an additional argument, \code{dataset}, is required by the function.
This argument expects a dataframe with data that was used to train the model. This is
necessary because for one-class svm, the R svm object does not contain information about
the data types of the features used to train the model. The exporter does not yet support
the formula interface for one-classification models, so the default S3 method must be used
to train the SVM. The data used to train the one-class SVM must be numeric and not of
integer class.
