Generate the PMML representation for an ada object from the package \pkg{ada}.

\details{
Export the ada model in the PMML MiningModel
(multiple models) format.  The MiningModel element consists of a list of
TreeModel elements, one in each model segment.

This function implements the discrete adaboost algorithm only.  Note that
each segment tree is a classification model, returning either -1 or 1.
However the MiningModel (ada algorithm) is doing a weighted sum of the
returned value, -1 or 1.  So the value of attribute functionName of element
MiningModel is set to "regression"; the value of attribute functionName of
each segment tree is also set to "regression" (they have to be the same as
the parent MiningModel per PMML schema). Although each segment/tree is being
named a "regression" tree, the actual returned score can only be -1 or 1,
which practically turns each segment into a classification tree.

The model in PMML format has 5 different outputs. The "rawValue" output is
the value of the model expressed as a tree model. The boosted tree model
uses a transformation of this value, this is the "boostValue" output. The
last 3 outputs are the predicted class and the probabilities of each of the
2 classes (The ada package Boosted Tree models can only handle binary
classification models).
