\description{
Implement a map between discrete values in accordance with the PMML element
\bold{MapValues}.
}
\details{
Map discrete values of an input variable to a discrete value of the
transformed variable. The map can be given in an external table file
referred to in the transform command or as a list of data frames, each data
frame defining a map transform for one variable.

Given a map from the combination of variables \bold{InVar1}, \bold{InVar2},
... to the transformed variable \bold{OutVar}, where the variables have the
data types \bold{InType1}, \bold{InType2}, ... and \bold{OutType}, the map
command is in the format:

\preformatted{
xform_info = "[InVar1,InVar2,... -> OutVar][InType1,InType2,... -> OutType]"
table = "TableFileName", default_value = "defVal", map_missing_to = "missingVal"
}

where \bold{TableFileName} is the name of the CSV file containing the map.
The map can be a N to 1 map where N is greater or equal to 1. The data types
of the variables can be any of the ones defined in the PMML format including
integer, double or string. \bold{defVal} is the default value of the
transformed variable and if any of the map input values are missing,
\bold{missingVal} is the value of the transformed variable.

The arguments InType, OutType, default_value and map_missing_to are optional.
The CSV file containing the table should not have any row and column
identifiers, and the values given must be in the same order as in the map
command. If the data types of the variables are not given, the data types of
the input variables are attempted to be determined from the \bold{boxData}
argument.  If that is not possible, the data type is assumed to be string.

It is also possible to give the maps to be implemented without an external
file using a list of data frames. Each data frame defines a map for 1 input
variable. Given a data frame with N+1 columns, it is assumed that the map is
a N to 1 map where the last column of the data frame corresponds to the
derived field. The 1st row is assumed to be the names of the fields and the
second row the data types of the fields. The rest of the rows define the
map; each combination of the input values in a row is mapped to the value in
the last column of that row. The second row with the data types of the
fields is not required. If not given, all fields are assumed to be strings.
In this input format, the 'default_value' and 'map_missing_to' parameters
should be vectors. The first element of each vector will correspond to the
derived field defined in the 1st element of the 'xform_info' list etc. These
are made clearer in the example below.

\examples{
# Load the standard audit dataset, part of the pmml package:
data(audit)

# First wrap the data:
audit_box <- xform_wrap(audit)
\dontrun{
# One of the variables, "Sex", has 2 possible values: "Male"
# and "Female". If these string values have to be mapped to a
# numeric value, a file has to be created, say "map_audit.csv",
# whose content is, for example:
#
#  Male,1
#  Female,2
#
# Transform the variable "Gender" to a variable "d_gender"
# such that:
#    if Sex = "Male" then d_sex = "1"
#    if Sex = "Female" then d_sex = "2"
#
# Give "d_sex" the value 0 if the input variable value is
# missing.
audit_box <- xform_map(audit_box,
  xform_info = "[Sex -> d_sex][string->integer]",
  table = "map_audit.csv", map_missing_to = "0"
)
}
# Same as above, with an extra variable, but using data frames.
# The top 2 rows give the variable names and their data types.
# The rest represent the map. For example, the third row
# indicates that when the input variable "Sex" has the value
# "Male" and the input variable "Employment" has
# the value "PSLocal", the output variable "d_sex" should have
# the value 1.
t <- list()
m <- data.frame(
  c("Sex", "string", "Male", "Female"),
  c("Employment", "string", "PSLocal", "PSState"),
  c("d_sex", "integer", 1, 0),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)
t[[1]] <- m

# Give default value as a vector and missing value as a string,
# this is only possible as there is only one map defined. If
# default values is not given, it will simply not be given in
# the PMML file as well. In general, the default values and the
# missing values should be given as a vector, each element of
# the vector corresponding to the element at the same index in
# the list. If these values are not given as a vector, they will
# be used for the first list element only.
audit_box <- xform_map(audit_box,
  xform_info = t, default_value = c(3),
  map_missing_to = "2"
)

# check what the pmml looks like
fit <- lm(Adjusted ~ ., data = audit_box$data)
fit_pmml <- pmml(fit, transforms = audit_box)
