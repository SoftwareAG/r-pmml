#' Modified 1984 United States Congressional Voting Records Database
#'
#' This data set includes votes for each of the U.S. House of Representatives
#' Congressmen on the 16 key votes identified by the CQA.  The CQA lists nine
#' different types of votes: voted for, paired for, and announced for (these
#' three simplified to yea), voted against, paired against, and announced
#' against (these three simplified to nay), voted present, voted present to
#' avoid conflict of interest, and did not vote or otherwise make a position
#' known (these three simplified to an unknown disposition).  Originally
#' containing a binomial variable "class" and 16 other binary variables, those
#' 16 variables have been renamed to simply "V1","V2",...,"V16".
